**CometDestroya** is a final project for my introductory computer science course, generated in NetLogo. <br> <br>
This is my own rendition of asteroids, designed from scratch at age 15 at Covid-19's start.<br> <br>
*CometDestroya Web.html* may be accessed on my <a href="http://riverstrum.com/coding/coding.html" target="_blank">Personal Website</a>, or *CometDestroya.nlogo* may be ran with NetLogo installed.
