**CometDestroya** is a final project for my introductory computer science course, generated in NetLogo. <br>
This is my own rendition of asteroids, designed from scratch at age 15 at Covid-19's start.<br>
*CometDestroya.html* may be downloaded and opened to run, or *CometDestroya.nlogo* may be downloaded and ran in the same folder as NetLogo's application folder.
